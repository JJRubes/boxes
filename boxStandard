Temporary standard for the language.
Nothing here is set in stone

a box has a '+' in each corner
the top and bottom edges are made up of '|' or '-'
or other characters which are interpretted as io
spaces ' ' are used to define the name of the box
if it is a definition.

  +- example box -a-+
  *                 .  this is a definition for a box labeled "example box"
  |                 o  it has 14 io pins: a*.obcdefghijk
  +bcdef----ghijk---+

a pin can be any character that is not '+', ' ', '-', '|'
a character can be used only once for either input or output
unless it not ambiguous which is input and output or if it is
being overloaded

  +--- example ----+
  |                |  example definition with a as both
  |     +---+      |  input and output

  |  +---------+  +---+   |  the inputs and outputs can
  x->a example b--o 1 |   |  be specified.
  |  +--a------+  +---+   |  it doesn't matter which
  |     |                 |  and both can be specified
  +-----o-----------------+

  +-------- overloaded add ------+
  |                              |  here x and y are overloaded

  |                              |  make a turn, I don't know
  |          +--------+          |  if I want to allow '+'
  x--string--x concat y--string--y  as a corner. Currently I
  |          +----o---+          |  won't because it's harder
  |               |              |  to parse.
  +---------------o--------------+

if there is a pin that could accept multiple types
and there is a pin that can accept a specific type
always choose the more specific type

a box can be a literal or a definition
a definition has a name, a literal does not

  +-- definiton --+  +---------+
  |               |  | literal |

literals include:
actual literals

how names work:
a box name is between 2 spaces along an edge
the first and last group of spaces are the start and end
of the name

all named "name"
   +-+  +-+
   | |  | |
   |      |  +- name -+  +-  name    +
   | n  n |  |        |  |           |
   | a  a |  +--------+  +-----------+
   | m  m |  +--------+
   | e  e |  |        |
   |      |  +- name -+
   | |  | |
   +-+  +-+

and names allow spaces

  +- box with spaces in the name -+
  |                               |
  +-------------------------------+

a name cannot be only spaces

Maybe have a waiting pin, that all it does is wait for the signal
